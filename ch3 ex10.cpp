/*Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and 
outputs the result. For example: 
+ 100 3.14 
* 4 5 
Read the operation into a string called operation and use an 
if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, 
if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double. 
Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div 
with their obvious meanings.*/
